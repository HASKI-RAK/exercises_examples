# Application Examples of Popular Software Patterns with React and TypeScript

This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of popular software design patterns implemented in a modern web application using React, TypeScript, Vite, Eslint, and Prettier. It aims to provide real-world examples of design patterns in action, making it easier for students to understand and apply these patterns in their projects.

This work is part of Software Engineering Education. The project is open-source and contributions are welcome.
